# Big Ole' Frog
You are a frog navigating around a pond in an attempt to collect food with a surprise. 

#####About: 
    As the user, you are controlling a frog using the arrowpad.
    You can move in any direction at any time. A series of small red objects(supposed to be some type of frog food)
    is scattered across the screen in random spots. Your goal is to collect all of the food on the screen to 
    move on to the next level. Each level will begin as soon as the last piece of food form the previous level is eaten. 
    All of this comes with a catch. As you are trying to eat this food, birds will be falling from the sky. These birds will
    be falling from random spots across the top of the screen. As you know, a bird is very dangerous and could kill you, 
    so be careful! As you increase in level, the birds will come in different speeds. Move fast, and stay alert!
